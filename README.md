# NITree

This is a proof of concept implementation for an algorithm that uses Named Identifiers (see [RFC 6920](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6920) ) to hash a given key-value data structure (e.g. JSON) into a merkle tree like structure can be shared wihtout loosing full fine grained data access control. Publishing this Named Identifiers Tree (root), e.g. on a distributed ledger, can be used to notarize the full data structure. Furthermore, RFC 6920 specifies a URL too query for the data behind the NI. The data owner being querried can then authorise the querying party and reveal parts or all of the data in the NITree. By checking the hashes, the querying party can be sure to receive authentic data.


## Specs

### Input

For simplicity, we consider only the following data types:
- A String is an Object
- An unordered List of Objects is an Object
- An unordered Map of Strings to Objects is an Object

SOme special cases:
- The empty String/List/Map are all considered to be the same (emty) Object `""`
- A list of a single element is considered the same as the element itself.

The Input to the NITree generating Algorithm may be any Object.

### Root

A root of an NITree is a named identifier of the form "ni://n-authority/alg;val" where
- "alg" is the name of a hashing algorithm, e.g. "sha-256", see [RFC 6920](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6920) for details. We will throughout use sha-256 for the specification, but of course any other cryptographic hash algorithm may be used in practise.
- "n-authority" is a domain name, e.g. "example.com". n-authority SHOULD be given for the main root in order to allow for data lookup. It MAY be omitted for sub-tree roots, in which case it is assumed to be the same as for the main root.
- "val" is the hash value

### Collisions

Different data inputs are to yield different main roots (up to collisions in the underlying hashing alg).

### Algorithm

#### Salted NIs for Strings

A string is converted into a root by first applying alg to the to generate a named identifier of the form
`ni://alg;val`. E.g. "Hello World!" yields 
```ni://sha-256;03ba204e50d126e4674c005e04d82e84c21366780af1f43bd54a37816b6ab340```

To prevent rainbow table/guessing attacks on the hash, the result SHOULD be salted and hashed again as follows:
A random salt is appended as a query parameter according to RFC 6920, e.g.
```
ni://sha-256;03ba204e50d126e4674c005e04d82e84c21366780af1f43bd54a37816b6ab340?salt=NIPSI2XQLTRCNIUAYBNNWV6K5Q
```
The length (entropy) of the salt can be adapted according to security needs. The resulting NI + salt is considered a string and hashed again into the NIroot, e.g.
```
ni://example.com/sha-256;22aada314d02532757013651bf5ca5c5ecd36640c2d47b3470abd9cfadd246da
```

The resulting NITree consists of the resulting root, the intermediate NI and the original string, e.g.
```
(
  "ni://example.com/sha-256;22aada314d02532757013651bf5ca5c5ecd36640c2d47b3470abd9cfadd246da",
  (
    "ni://sha-256;03ba204e50d126e4674c005e04d82e84c21366780af1f43bd54a37816b6ab340?salt=NIPSI2XQLTRCNIUAYBNNWV6K5Q",
      "Hello World!"
  )
)
```

If the original String already contains enough entropy, e.g. a large random number such as a serial, the salting step MAY be omitted. The Empty String should always be salted.

#### Combining NIs

To form a Merkle Tree, an operation of hashing a pair of hashes is needed. A simple way of doing so is to concatenate the hashes as strings and hashing the result. For two NIs, "ni://n-authority1/alg1;val1?query1" and "ni://n-authority2/alg2;val2?query2" we define the combined NI "ni://n-authority/alg;val" to be computed by lexikographically sorting val1?query1 < val2?query2 and then applying the hashing algorithm "alg" to the concatenation "val1?query1val2?query2".


#### NIs for Lists

For an unordered list, conmpute the NITree for all elements. The n-authority parts for the elements SHOULD be omitted. If an n-authority is given for one element's NIRoot, it MUST be given for all. The NIRoot of the list is then generated by 
- lexicographic sorting of the elements' NIRoots
- pairwise combining the NIroots to get a list with half (ceil) as many entries (leave the last one alone for odd list size)
- repeat until there is only one NIRoot left
This standard merkle tree conctruction yields the NIRoot of the list. The NITree consists of the full merkle tree.

For Example `["Hello", "World"]` yields the NITree leaves
```
[
  ("ni://sha-256;66a045b452102c59d840ec097d59d9467e13a3f34f6494e539ffd32c1bb35f18", "Hello"),
  ("ni://sha-256;aa1db5c660d3d1f3f4f9361b9848694300929be94b74c84452a87420c59e5df9", "World")
]
```
where salting has been omitted for simplicity in this example, but should be used for similar string values in practise.
The next iteration in this example yields the full NITree
```
(
  ni://sha-256;e6e89c66b353e5ac4046831ac371750d139f871085647a6216c7e080cf5d07f9,
  (
    (
      "ni://sha-256;66a045b452102c59d840ec097d59d9467e13a3f34f6494e539ffd32c1bb35f18",
      "Hello"
    ),
    (
      "ni://sha-256;aa1db5c660d3d1f3f4f9361b9848694300929be94b74c84452a87420c59e5df9",
      "World"
    )
  )
)
```


#### NIs for Maps

The NITree of the map is generated by 
- Compute and combine the NIRoots of the key and value pairs in the map to get a list of strings
- Apply the above algorithm for lists

For example (again omitting hashing), the map
`{"A" : "Hello", "B" : "World"}`
yields the NITree
```
(
  ni://example.com/sha-256;f4d4c5b32bf30934291a2ca6823c7a91a51acd69f438169658612b0e964626a7,
  (
    "ni://sha-256;060ec99b0c06faea8255e0089497945e88853421f61a65f0e8b4abebaddb48a8",
    {
      ("ni://sha-256;06f961b802bc46ee168555f066d28f4f0e9afdf3f88174c1ee6f9de004fc30a0", "A"):
      ("ni://sha-256;66a045b452102c59d840ec097d59d9467e13a3f34f6494e539ffd32c1bb35f18", "Hello")
    }
  ),
  (
    "ni://sha-256;b22abcf4712dbbf546d7e0a6d5dfcdb1939bea205f61d06587e30b38c85171ad",
    {
      ("ni://sha-256;c0cde77fa8fef97d476c10aad3d2d54fcc2f336140d073651c2dcccf1e379fd6", "B"):
      ("ni://sha-256;aa1db5c660d3d1f3f4f9361b9848694300929be94b74c84452a87420c59e5df9", "World")
    }
  )
)
```
